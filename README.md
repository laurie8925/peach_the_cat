# Peach the Cat - Don't get Distracted

A simple canvas Javascript game inspired by Chrome dinosaur game and Neko Atsume game.  
Try out the game here: [Live game](https://laurieyeh.com/peach-the-cat/)

## How to play

The game is controlled using the space bar, and it starts when you press this key. You can adjust the height of your jump by holding down the space bar: a longer press results in a higher jump, while a shorter press leads to a shorter jump. The game is compatible with various devices, including mobile phones and tablets, in both portrait and landscape modes. For mobile and tablet users, control is achieved by tapping the screen instead of using the space bar. Holding the screen for a longer duration will make Peach jump higher, and holding it for a shorter duration will result in a shorter jump.
