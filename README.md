# Peach the Cat - Don't get Distracted

A simple canvas Javascript game inspired by Chrome dinosaur game and Neko Atsume game. 

## How to play

The control of the game is the space bar. The game begins when you press the space button. You can control how high you want to jump by holding it or you can  make shorter jumps by holding the space for shorter period of time. The game can be enjoyed on variety of devices such as mobile and tablet on portait or landscape viewpoint. The control for mobile and tablet is tapping the screen instead of the space button. The longer you hold the screen, the higher Peach will jump and the shorter you hold the screen, the shorter Peach will jump.
